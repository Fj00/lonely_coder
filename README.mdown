What is this nonsense?
-----------------------------
A ruby gem for interacting with [OKCupid](http://www.okcupid.com/). OKCupid doesn't actually have an API, so we use mechanize to interact with the site. Screen scraping isn't terribly fast, but it's pretty zippy compared to the other option â€“ doing nothing.

How does it work?
-----------------------------
You'll need an OKCupid account (it's free) because most of the site is behind authentication.  You can create a new connection to the site.

    require 'lonely_coder'
    okc = OKCupid.new('yourusername', 'yourpassword')
    
Once you have a connection you can check out a person's profile
    
    trek = okc.profile_for('thetrek')
    trek.match # => 99. Damn, he's pretty sweet
    trek.location # => 'Ann Arbor, Michigan'
    `open #{trek.profile_thumb_urls.first}` # HOT. DAMN.

Go ahead and ask for `username`, `match`, `friend`, `enemy`, `location`, `age`, `sex`, `orientation`, `single`, `last_online`, `ethnicity`, `height`, `body_type`, `diet`, `smokes`,  `drinks`, `drugs`, `religion`, `sign`, `education`, `job`, `income`, `offspring`, `pets`, `speaks`, and `profile_thumb_urls`
